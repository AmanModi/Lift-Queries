# Lift-Queries
There are 7 floors in BH3 and only 2 lifts. Initially Lift A is at the ground floor and Lift B at the top floor. Whenever someone calls the lift from N th floor, the lift closest to that floor comes to pick him up. If both the lifts are at equidistant from the N th floor, them the lift from the lower floor comes up.
